Start game off by choosing a random song order and looping through
	Play (This is automatic when the game starts)
Keep playing in loop until:
	pause=$true (pauses current position of current song)
		Used when bomb or win round occurs
	pause=$false (Unpauses current position of current song)
		Used when bomb or win round ends
	mute=$true (mutes music, even though it'll keep playing. Also mutes end of round music)
		User manually pushes mute button or use mute setting stored in their config
	mute=$false (Unmutes music)
		User manually pushes mute button or use mute setting stored in their config
	A stop (Stops the music)
		On close event of PS session? I think this is automatic.
---------------------------
Only call Sound module once. After that only change SoundConfig.txt with requested changes, including song.
	The Sound module will read the SoundConfig file ever 200ms and check for changes.
	If Pause is $true, it pauses the current song.
	If Pause is $false, it unpauses current song.
	If Mute is $true, it mutes all sounds.
	If Mute is $false, it does not mute any sounds.
	
Have a separate job that simply loops through the songs after they've been set, and then
