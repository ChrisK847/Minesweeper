# Minesweeper
This is the start of my own version of Minesweeper.

To play the game, run the MineSweeper.ps1 file.

This game has music and images, it allows you to create and save a profile, allows you to set your game difficulty and field size, and allows you to right-click to mark where you think a bomb is.

Here's a demo video:

I will be fixing a few bugs soonish to allow the game to run smoothly.
